**ZeroIn**

**What it does**

ZeroIn helps facilitate learning by providing smart annotations to any lecture video. Simply upload a file to the client and it will make a request to our server, which will provide video annotations as a response. 

Not in the mood to study? ZeroIn can also help satisfy that procrastination urge. By streamlining study breaks, people will feel a faster mental reset, and focus more afterwards. The way we do it is by having a tab dedicated to making video highlights. By processing the video and retaining only the best parts, people will get what they came for and have time left to spare!
